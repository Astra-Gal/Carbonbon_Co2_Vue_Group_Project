## The Brief
We set out to build a personal Carbon footprint calculator app using Vue that builds a picture of a user's carbon footprint based on their lifestyle. We were keen to make our app fun to use (hence the sometimes irreverent question style!), as we felt people were more receptive to learning things when they were having fun.

### MVP
A user should be able to:

* submit values for various aspects of their lifestyle (e.g. diet, commute, recycling and heating routine, holiday habits, etc) and view their CO2 footprint. You'll need to create your own (simple) tested model to calculate this.
* update the values to see the effect on their CO2 footprint.
view the CO2 footprint result in a visually interesting ways.
### Extensions
* Calculate and visualise projections of CO2 savings based on a user's input.
* Show the CO2 footprint result before and after the user has updated the values.
